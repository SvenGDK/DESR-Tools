## W-A-R-N-I-N-G
NONE of flags (boot files) can be used blindly!
Intended to use only by people who knows what they doing.
Not proper usage, expecially in 2.xx case, results in all DATA LOSS and even console BRICK.
I'm not responsible for any of that.

## Firmware 1.xx:
Place *.opt files as is in "xfrom0:/BIEXEC-SYSTEM/".

## Firmware 2.xx:
Chose one file, depend of task, rename it to "bootflag.txt" then place in "xfrom0:/BIEXEC-SYSTEM/".

Special thanks for krHACKen and El_isra for files sharing and all people involved in reverse engineering DESR models.
